## FLUX_RS
A toy scripting language for learning purposes
Design goals are:
* Minimal syntax
* Null safety (normal type vs nullable type)
* Functional programming features

## Status
Currently has tables as objects, statements and most expressions.

## Roadmap
* Implement statements (done)
* Implement functions (as first class citizen) (done)
* Implement closures
* Implement simple OOP (member functions for tables)
* Simple patterns matching for tuple expressions
* Nullable variables and static checking for nullable types
* Optimization for tables used as arrays (Like lua)
